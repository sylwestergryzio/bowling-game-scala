## Bowling Game implementation in Scala.

>The idea comes from the Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, 
and Practices book by Robert C. Martin. The implementation of the game inside 
the book is in Java.


This implementation is my way to recall knowledge about Scala. I hope it to evolve over time.


>The rules and terminology of a bowling game can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling).
